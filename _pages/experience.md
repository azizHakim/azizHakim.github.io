## Work Experience

### **Graduate Assistant | Grand Valley State University | Grand Rapids, MI, USA | January 2023 - Present**

#### Project: Automatic Test Case Generation
 - Conducted experiments with zero-shot and few-shot prompt engineering techniques initially on ChatGPT, then on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA to create an unstructured to structured requirements converter.
 - Developed a multi‑panel visualization tool utilizing Flask and React to convert semi‑structured requirements into structured formats.
 - Built an active learning pipeline to facilitate the continuous training and testing of the CodeT5 model, enhancing its ability to structure software test requirements.
 - Built GPU enabled Docker containerized LLM API CodeT5 converter API.


### **Machine Learning Engineer | [Reea Digital](https://www.reeadigital.com) | Dhaka, Bangladesh | November 2022 - December 2022**

#### Project: Watch Innoviant
 - Evaluated the performance of BERT variants like ALBERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT for automatic data preprocessing and annotation using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP)  models at the research and development phase.
 - Fine‑tuned an Electra-QA model to annotate watch features from raw descriptions.
 - Achieved over a 10‑fold reduction in data annotation costs and time by leveraging large language models for data annotation.


### **Research Engineer | United International University | Dhaka, Bangladesh | March 2022 - September 2022**

#### Project: Smart Receptionist
 - Designed and developed a full-stack artificial intelligence based Smart Receptionist web application, with React frontend, Flask backend, and MySQL database.
 - Containerized and deployed the microservices on a Linux server using Docker and Nginx.




### **Software Engineer, Machine Learning | [Gigalogy](https://gigalogy.com) | Dhaka, Bangladesh | March 2020 - October 2021**

#### Project: NLU
 - Built NLU REST API back-end engine, enabling integration into existing chatbots and prioritizing optimal user experience.
 - Demonstrated strong analytical and problem-solving skills by crafting a complex JSON parser.
 - Developed an AI voice assistant based on the NLU engine.


#### Project: Computer Vision
 - Evaluated various deep learning based object detection algorithms for inference and memory usage on AWS EC2.
 - Created computer vision APIs using OpenCV and TensorFlow for object detection, age-gender prediction, and emotion recognition from both images and videos.
 - Enhanced deep learning based object detection inference time by over 50% by resolving CUDA GPU memory leaks in Darknet and containerized for production.
 - Implemented the scheduled batch upload of detection results to AWS S3 using Celery and Redis.


#### Project: Product Search Engine
 - Created a product search engine using Elasticsearch with text and categorical filters.
 - Added image recommendations to the existing recommendation engine through image processing and feature vectorization.


#### Project: Budget Optimization for Ad Campaigns
 - Implemented a machine learning based budget prediction feature for online ad campaigns through feature engineering and clustering.



## Internships
### **Intern | [Solution Art](https://solutionart.net) | Dhaka, Bangladesh | December, 2017**

- Configured a private Instant Messaging (IM) server to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) connections for audio, video, and text messaging.
- Used prosody as the XMPP communication server and Jitsi as the XMPP client.
