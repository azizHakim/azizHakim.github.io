## Opensource projects I have been working on

### **rag-chatapp: A financial assistant chatbot powered by ChatGPT and Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG)**

- Built with Streamlit, LlamaIndex, and OpenAI API
- Answers queries regarding finance by scraping through the latest financial news articles.



### **Enhanced pyvis: Added graphical edit functionality to the pyvis module**

- Integrated an editable graph feature so you can add, edit delete, and update nodes and edges visually. 
- Included a download option to save the modified graph (nodes, edges) in JSON.
