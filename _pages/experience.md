## Work Experience

### **Graduate Assistant | Grand Valley State University | Grand Rapids, MI, USA | January 2023 - Present**

#### Project: Automatic Test Case Generation
 - Conducted experiments with zero-shot and few-shot prompt engineering techniques initially on ChatGPT, then on
open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA to create an unstructured to structured requirement converter.
 - Designed a multi‑panel visualization tool utilizing Flask and React, Docker, and MongoDB to convert semi‑structured
requirements into knowledge graphs and structured formats.
 - Built an active learning pipeline to facilitate the continuous training and testing of the CodeT5 model.
 - Devised a GPU enabled Docker containerized LLM API and CodeT5 converter API using LangChain.
 - Currently fine-tuning Mistral-7B with custom unstructured to structured requirement conversion data using PEFT and LoRA


### **Machine Learning Engineer | [Reea Digital](https://www.reeadigital.com) | Dhaka, Bangladesh | November 2022 - December 2022**

#### Project: Watch Innoviant
 - Evaluated the performance of BERT based state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models like ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and DistilBERT for automatic data preprocessing and annotation at the research and development phase.
 - Fine‑tuned an Electra-QA model to annotate watch features from raw descriptions.
 - Over a 10‑fold reduction in data annotation costs and time by leveraging large language models for data annotation.
### **Research Engineer | United International University | Dhaka, Bangladesh | March 2022 - September 2022**

#### Project: Smart Receptionist
 - Developed full-stack artificial intelligence based Smart Receptionist web application, with React frontend, Flask backend,
and MySQL database.
 - Deployed the microservices on a Linux server using Docker and Nginx containerization.



### **Software Engineer, Machine Learning | [Gigalogy](https://gigalogy.com) | Dhaka, Bangladesh | March 2020 - October 2021**

#### Project: NLU
 - Built NLU, an intent and named entity recognition (NER) engine, capable of integrating into existing chatbots with FastAPI.
 - crafted a complex JSON parser to store NLU data into MySQL database.
 - Devised an AI voice assistant based on the NLU engine.


#### Project: Computer Vision
 - Created computer vision based REST API using OpenCV and TensorFlow for age-gender prediction, and emotion
recognition from images and videos.
 - Evaluated YOLO object detection algorithm for inference and memory usage.
 - Experimented with TFLite and ONNX conversion of object detection models.
 - Enhanced deep learning based object detection inference time by over 50% by resolving CUDA GPU memory leaks in
Darknet and deployed containerized microservice on AWS EC2.
 - Composed a scheduled batch upload of object detection results to AWS S3 using Celery and Redis


#### Project: Product Search Engine
 - Created a product search engine using Elasticsearch with text and categorical filters.
 - Integrated image recommendations to existing recommendation engine through image processing and feature vectorization.


#### Project: Budget Optimization for Ad Campaigns
 - Implemented a machine learning based budget prediction feature for online ad campaigns.


## Internships
### **Intern | [Solution Art](https://solutionart.net) | Dhaka, Bangladesh | December, 2017**

- Configured a private Instant Messaging (IM) server to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) connections for audio, video, and text messaging.
- Used prosody as the XMPP communication server and Jitsi as the XMPP client.
